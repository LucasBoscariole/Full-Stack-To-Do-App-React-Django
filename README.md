# Full-Stack-To-Do-App-React-Django


### First project made with django and react.

#### Currently learning Python and Django in the backend part.

      - In the django backend part of the project, I created a backend API with a database in order to store all to-dos.

      - In the front end it's a simple React app with typescript and bootstrap.

Project made following https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-to-do-application-using-django-and-react

**Obs: *I'm learning Python and Django by myself***
